    "# Building a Wellness Agent Using ReACT Prompting Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "ReACT (Reasoning + Acting) prompting is a powerful method for developing intelligent agents capable of reasoning and executing actions iteratively. In this guide, we’ll explore creating a wellness-focused agent using this technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to ReACT lies in crafting a detailed and specific system message. This message defines the agent's behavior by interleaving thought, action, and observation steps. By providing an example output in the prompt, you can guide the model’s responses effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a simplified structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Thought Step**: The model processes the user query and formulates a plan.\n",
    "2. **Action Steps**: The agent performs specific actions, such as retrieving data or analyzing input.\n",
    "3. **Observation Step**: The model reflects on the results of the actions and adjusts its approach as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps are repeated iteratively until the objective is achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a user asks for stress management tips, the agent might think about relevant strategies, retrieve data on mindfulness techniques, and observe user feedback to refine its suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging ReACT prompting, you can create sophisticated agents capable of dynamic reasoning, making them ideal for wellness applications and beyond."
